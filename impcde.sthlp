{phang}{opt depvar} - this specifies the outcome variable.

{phang}{opt dvar(varname)} - this specifies the treatment (exposure) variable.

{phang}{opt mvar(varname)} - this specifies the mediator variable.

{phang}{opt d(real)} - this specifies the reference level of treatment.

{phang}{opt dstar(real)} - this specifies the alternative level of treatment. Together, (d - dstar) defines
the treatment contrast of interest.

{phang}{opt m(real)} - this specifies the level of the mediator at which the controlled direct effect 
is evaluated. If there is no treatment-mediator interaction, then the controlled direct effect
is the same at all levels of the mediator and thus an arbitary value can be chosen.

{phang}{opt yreg}{cmd:(}{it:string}{cmd:)}} - this specifies the form of regression model to be estimated for the outcome. 
Options are {opt regress}, {opt logit}, or {opt poisson}.

{title:Options}

{phang}{opt cvars(varlist)} - this option specifies the list of baseline covariates to be included in the analysis. Categorical 
variables need to be coded as a series of dummy variables before being entered as covariates.

{phang}{opt nointer:action} - this option specifies whether a treatment-mediator interaction is not to be
included in the outcome model (the default assumes an interaction is present).

{phang}{opt cxd} - this option specifies that all two-way interactions between the treatment and baseline covariates are
included in the mediator and outcome models.

{phang}{opt cxm} - this option specifies that all two-way interactions between the mediator and baseline covariates are
included in the outcome model.

{phang}{opt reps(integer 200)} - this option specifies the number of replications for bootstrap resampling (the default is 200).

{phang}{opt strata(varname)} - this option specifies a variable that identifies resampling strata. If this option is specified, 
then bootstrap samples are taken independently within each stratum.

{phang}{opt cluster(varname)} - this option specifies a variable that identifies resampling clusters. If this option is specified,
then the sample drawn during each replication is a bootstrap sample of clusters.

{phang}{opt level(cilevel)} - this option specifies the confidence level for constructing bootstrap confidence intervals. If this 
option is omitted, then the default level of 95% is used.

{phang}{opt seed(passthru)} - this option specifies the seed for bootstrap resampling. If this option is omitted, then a random 
seed is used and the results cannot be replicated. {p_end}

{phang}{opt detail} - this option prints the fitted model for outcome.

{title:Description}

{pstd}{cmd:impcde} estimates controlled direct effects using regression imputation. A single model for the outcome is fit conditional 
on treatment, the mediator, and baseline covariates (if specified). This model may be a linear, logistic, or poisson regression.

{pstd}{cmd:impcde} provides an estimate of the controlled direct effect.{p_end}
